# gene-multiplayer-mgmt-game

I have The inventory and items can be moved around along with the crafting menu and PunnentSquare that shows 1 of the stats.
When creating new objects, it takes from the parents stats (the Gene part).
I have started looking into implementing network framework.



Todo:
Flush out the inventory and item creation (with other stat values and dominant/recessive genes).
Finish the crafting section (adding tabs to show other stats).
Add the farming/shop part of the game (mamagement portion).
Add start screen (with place to connect to multiplayer game).
Finish adding the multiplayer portion. (Competing with other player to make the most money/capitol)
